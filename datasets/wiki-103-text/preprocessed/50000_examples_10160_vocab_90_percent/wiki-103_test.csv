However Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium   isotope  which makes up only about     of natural uranium  was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons  although this was not yet universally accepted  Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed  They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium   with a radius of    centimetres     in  could suffice  This amount resembled approximately  kilogram     lb  of uranium    These results led to the Frisch  Peierls memorandum  which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms program in Britain  This marked the beginning of an aggressive approach towards uranium enrichment and the development of an atomic bomb  They now began to investigate processes by which they could successfully separate the uranium isotope,"[86, 0, 0, 23, 0, 12, 1, 1825, 3484, 6810, 24, 1022, 59, 60, 67, 2, 912, 3484, 7, 1350, 1158, 11, 8532, 13, 1567, 8334, 124, 26, 7, 31, 881, 0, 1342, 0, 3, 0, 21, 641, 422, 5, 0, 30, 993, 5865, 2, 756, 954, 988, 11, 1836, 8532, 4, 3484, 5, 25, 6133, 401, 70, 660, 2241, 36, 816, 6, 8468, 10057, 2, 3484, 13, 6, 7029, 2, 8768, 4, 123, 0, 26, 1314, 8008, 799, 0, 2085, 2, 3484, 90, 1426, 229, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 24, 7, 1, 993, 2985, 4, 1, 322, 2, 1, 1836, 1389, 725, 4, 824, 26, 1363, 1, 645, 2, 22, 3528, 1471, 538, 3484, 0, 3, 1, 322, 2, 22, 3402, 2041, 36, 216, 129, 5, 3885, 4224, 14, 24, 36, 123, 1757, 1210, 1, 3484, 6810]"

Photons  like all quantum objects  exhibit wave  like and particle  like properties  Their dual wave  particle nature can be difficult to visualize  The photon displays clearly wave  like phenomena such as diffraction and interference on the length scale of its wavelength  For example  a single photon passing through a double  slit experiment exhibits interference phenomena but only if no measure was made at the slit  A single photon passing through a double  slit experiment lands on the screen with a probability distribution given by its interference pattern determined by Maxwell s equations  However  experiments confirm that the photon is not a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation  it does not spread out as it propagates  nor does it divide when it encounters a beam splitter  Rather  the photon seems to be a point  like particle since it is absorbed or emitted as a whole by arbitrarily small systems  systems much smaller than its wavelength  such as an atomic nucleus      m across  or even the point  like electron  Nevertheless  the photon is not a point  like particle whose trajectory is shaped probabilistically by the electromagnetic field  as conceived by Einstein and others  that hypothesis was also refuted by the photon  correlation experiments cited above  According to our present understanding  the electromagnetic field itself is produced by photons  which in turn result from a local gauge symmetry and the laws of quantum field theory  see the Second quantization and Gauge boson sections below,"[0, 131, 52, 5642, 3351, 5579, 1645, 131, 3, 8512, 131, 2786, 30, 4762, 1645, 8512, 886, 110, 25, 1126, 5, 0, 1, 9893, 3653, 3561, 1645, 131, 10064, 81, 10, 0, 3, 5736, 9, 1, 900, 1420, 2, 37, 0, 11, 559, 6, 174, 9893, 1475, 91, 6, 999, 0, 3632, 7731, 5736, 10064, 27, 60, 142, 72, 2437, 7, 77, 16, 1, 0, 6, 174, 9893, 1475, 91, 6, 999, 0, 3632, 1834, 9, 1, 1240, 13, 6, 0, 1841, 319, 14, 37, 5736, 2794, 1807, 14, 5672, 8, 8530, 86, 3886, 7252, 12, 1, 9893, 15, 31, 6, 355, 0, 2, 0, 3248, 20, 599, 31, 1967, 63, 10, 20, 0, 2421, 599, 20, 7121, 46, 20, 3997, 6, 3289, 0, 470, 1, 9893, 2305, 5, 25, 6, 283, 131, 8512, 139, 20, 15, 5087, 39, 0, 10, 6, 1038, 14, 0, 250, 1438, 1438, 189, 1076, 70, 37, 0, 81, 10, 22, 3402, 7622, 109, 421, 39, 244, 1, 283, 131, 4876, 1985, 1, 9893, 15, 31, 6, 283, 131, 8512, 713, 0, 15, 2258, 0, 14, 1, 0, 426, 10, 4204, 14, 7167, 3, 499, 12, 5473, 7, 34, 0, 14, 1, 9893, 0, 3886, 2078, 663, 238, 5, 737, 509, 3429, 1, 0, 426, 763, 15, 372, 14, 0, 24, 4, 777, 467, 19, 6, 297, 5116, 7479, 3, 1, 1818, 2, 5642, 426, 1477, 520, 1, 79, 0, 3, 5116, 0, 2243, 1271]"

The mucilage produced by Drosera has remarkable elastic properties and has made this genus a very attractive subject in biomaterials research  In one recent study  the adhesive mucilages of three species  D binata  D capensis  and D spatulata  were analyzed for nanofiber and nanoparticle content  Using atomic force microscopy  transmission electron microscopy  and energy  dispersive X  ray spectroscopy  researchers were able to observe networks of nanofibers and nanoparticles of various sizes within the mucilage residues  In addition  calcium  magnesium  and chlorine  key components of biological salts  were identified  These nanoparticles are theorized to increase the viscosity and stickiness of the mucilage  in turn increasing the effectiveness of the trap  More importantly for biomaterials research  however  is the fact that  when dried  the mucin provides a suitable substrate for the attachment of living cells  This has important implications for tissue engineering  especially because of the elastic qualities of the adhesive  Essentially  a coating of Drosera mucilage on a surgical implant  such as a replacement hip or an organ transplant  could drastically improve the rate of recovery and decrease the potential for rejection  because living tissue can effectively attach and grow on it  The authors also suggest a wide variety of applications for Drosera mucin  including wound treatment  regenerative medicine  or enhancing synthetic adhesives  Also of note  because this mucilage can stretch to nearly a million times its original size and is readily available for use  it can be an extremely cost  efficient source of biomaterial,"[1, 0, 372, 14, 0, 44, 6555, 0, 2786, 3, 44, 77, 26, 1811, 6, 256, 5691, 1162, 4, 0, 684, 4, 35, 1238, 774, 1, 0, 0, 2, 62, 249, 288, 0, 288, 0, 3, 288, 0, 21, 0, 11, 0, 3, 0, 1923, 356, 3402, 233, 0, 5558, 4876, 0, 3, 952, 0, 549, 1367, 0, 4741, 21, 422, 5, 6824, 8059, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2, 431, 7862, 261, 1, 0, 0, 4, 496, 8355, 0, 3, 0, 1011, 3838, 2, 4591, 0, 21, 1476, 90, 0, 29, 0, 5, 942, 1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 1, 0, 4, 777, 1465, 1, 6529, 2, 1, 6215, 54, 9961, 11, 0, 684, 86, 15, 1, 914, 12, 46, 8575, 1, 0, 1950, 6, 3568, 7152, 11, 1, 6769, 2, 848, 1942, 26, 44, 544, 8531, 11, 5809, 1999, 871, 132, 2, 1, 0, 5771, 2, 1, 0, 3645, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 9, 6, 0, 0, 81, 10, 6, 2643, 2217, 39, 22, 3261, 0, 123, 0, 2487, 1, 1114, 2, 4911, 3, 5621, 1, 1361, 11, 9679, 132, 848, 5809, 110, 2425, 0, 3, 2539, 9, 20, 1, 3014, 34, 2899, 6, 758, 1074, 2, 3835, 11, 0, 0, 108, 7896, 1500, 0, 3446, 39, 0, 9123, 0, 34, 2, 1850, 132, 26, 0, 110, 4638, 5, 775, 6, 143, 253, 37, 232, 882, 3, 15, 6943, 567, 11, 163, 20, 110, 25, 22, 2290, 971, 5469, 1034, 2, 0]"

The energy balance of the snowpack itself is dictated by several heat exchange processes  The snowpack absorbs solar shortwave radiation that is partially blocked by cloud cover and reflected by snow surface  A long  wave heat exchange takes place between the snowpack and its surrounding environment that includes overlying air mass  tree cover and clouds  Heat exchange takes place by convection between the snowpack and the overlaying air mass  and it is governed by the temperature gradient and wind speed  Moisture exchange between the snowpack and the overlying air mass is accompanied by latent heat transfer that is influenced by vapor pressure gradient and air wind  Rain on snow can add significant amounts of thermal energy to the snowpack  A generally insignificant heat exchange takes place by conduction between the snowpack and the ground  The small temperature change from before to after a snowfall is a result of the heat transfer between the snowpack and the air  As snow degrades  its surface can develop characteristic ablation textures such as suncups or penitentes,"[1, 952, 3024, 2, 1, 0, 763, 15, 0, 14, 101, 2242, 2244, 4224, 1, 0, 0, 2968, 0, 3248, 12, 15, 3441, 4266, 14, 4342, 712, 3, 3019, 14, 1951, 870, 6, 133, 1645, 2242, 2244, 998, 198, 65, 1, 0, 3, 37, 1666, 1842, 12, 970, 0, 230, 954, 1490, 712, 3, 5900, 2242, 2244, 998, 198, 14, 2356, 65, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 230, 954, 3, 20, 15, 8042, 14, 1, 2249, 0, 3, 1039, 656, 8868, 2244, 65, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 230, 954, 15, 1947, 14, 0, 2242, 2585, 12, 15, 1460, 14, 0, 890, 0, 3, 230, 1039, 2160, 9, 1951, 110, 3095, 611, 3612, 2, 6753, 952, 5, 1, 0, 6, 579, 0, 2242, 2244, 998, 198, 14, 0, 65, 1, 0, 3, 1, 484, 1, 250, 2249, 762, 19, 75, 5, 32, 6, 0, 15, 6, 467, 2, 1, 2242, 2585, 65, 1, 0, 3, 1, 230, 10, 1951, 0, 37, 870, 110, 1649, 4318, 0, 0, 81, 10, 0, 39, 0]"

History,[200]
Carbon monoxide has a higher diffusion coefficient compared to oxygen and the only enzyme in the human body that produces carbon monoxide is heme oxygenase which is located in all cells and breaks down heme  Under normal conditions carbon monoxide levels in the plasma are approximately  mmHg because it has a higher diffusion coefficient and the body easily gets rid of any CO made  When CO is not ventilated it binds to hemoglobin  which is the principal oxygen  carrying compound in blood  this produces a compound known as carboxyhemoglobin  The traditional belief is that carbon monoxide toxicity arises from the formation of carboxyhemoglobin  which decreases the oxygen  carrying capacity of the blood and inhibits the transport  delivery  and utilization of oxygen by the body  The affinity between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide is approximately  times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen so hemoglobin binds to carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen,"[2732, 8493, 44, 6, 859, 8363, 0, 917, 5, 3435, 3, 1, 60, 5948, 4, 1, 614, 471, 12, 5199, 2732, 8493, 15, 0, 0, 24, 15, 487, 4, 52, 1942, 3, 4340, 180, 0, 113, 1675, 996, 2732, 8493, 1171, 4, 1, 0, 29, 799, 0, 132, 20, 44, 6, 859, 8363, 0, 3, 1, 471, 2248, 2388, 0, 2, 156, 543, 77, 46, 543, 15, 31, 0, 20, 0, 5, 0, 24, 15, 1, 2119, 3435, 2124, 4363, 4, 1256, 26, 5199, 6, 4363, 120, 10, 0, 1, 1080, 2847, 15, 12, 2732, 8493, 0, 0, 19, 1, 1365, 2, 0, 24, 0, 1, 3435, 2124, 1752, 2, 1, 1256, 3, 0, 1, 1247, 4144, 3, 0, 2, 3435, 14, 1, 471, 1, 7756, 65, 0, 3, 2732, 8493, 15, 799, 253, 3251, 70, 1, 7756, 65, 0, 3, 3435, 115, 0, 0, 5, 2732, 8493, 4, 6975, 5, 3435]"

Rainilaiarivony s first royal wife  Queen Rasoherina  died on  April   and was succeeded by her cousin Ranavalona II  crowned on  September   who  like Rasoherina  was a widow of Radama II  Ranavalona II was a pupil of Protestant missionaries and had converted to Christianity  Rainilaiarivony recognized the growing power of Christianity on the island and identified the need to bring it under his influence in order to avert destabilizing cultural and political power struggles  The Prime Minister encouraged the new queen to Christianize the court through a public baptism ceremony at Andohalo on  February   the day of their marriage  In this ceremony the supernatural royal talismans were ordered to be destroyed and replaced by the Bible  The Christianization of the court and the establishment of the independent royal Protestant chapel on the palace grounds prompted the wide  scale conversion of hundreds of thousands of Malagasy  These conversions were commonly motivated by a desire to express political allegiance to the Crown  and as such were largely nominal  with the majority of converts practicing a syncretic blend of Christian and traditional religions  Rainilaiarivony s biographers conclude that the Prime Minister s own conversion was also largely a political gesture and most likely did not denote a genuine spiritual shift until late in his life  if ever  Some local officials attempted to force conversions to Protestantism by mandating church attendance and persecuting Catholics  but Rainilaiarivony quickly responded to quell these overzealous practices  The Prime Minister s criminalization of polygamy and alcohol consumption  as well as the declaration of Sunday as a day of rest  were likewise inspired by the growing British and Protestant influences in the country  The Christianization of the court came at a steep personal price  with the outlawing of polygamy  Rainilaiarivony was forced to repudiate his first wife  The Prime Minister was deeply saddened by this necessity and by the consequent souring of his relationships with Rasoanalina and their children after the divorce,"[0, 8, 28, 329, 548, 781, 0, 427, 9, 164, 3, 7, 2617, 14, 33, 4623, 0, 337, 6221, 9, 144, 41, 131, 0, 7, 6, 4611, 2, 0, 337, 0, 337, 7, 6, 9433, 2, 5260, 9484, 3, 23, 1992, 5, 3830, 0, 2188, 1, 1395, 280, 2, 3830, 9, 1, 314, 3, 1476, 1, 1087, 5, 1529, 20, 113, 17, 772, 4, 275, 5, 0, 0, 1280, 3, 399, 280, 6589, 1, 1231, 786, 2671, 1, 43, 781, 5, 0, 1, 318, 91, 6, 260, 8243, 2260, 16, 0, 9, 255, 1, 117, 2, 30, 980, 4, 26, 2260, 1, 8015, 329, 0, 21, 683, 5, 25, 930, 3, 661, 14, 1, 3215, 1, 0, 2, 1, 318, 3, 1, 2330, 2, 1, 972, 329, 5260, 2536, 9, 1, 1849, 2223, 2751, 1, 758, 1420, 3963, 2, 2714, 2, 2181, 2, 0, 90, 0, 21, 1828, 7101, 14, 6, 2101, 5, 2050, 399, 9568, 5, 1, 2109, 3, 10, 81, 21, 1066, 0, 13, 1, 982, 2, 0, 9926, 6, 0, 7566, 2, 864, 3, 1080, 9171, 0, 8, 0, 9968, 12, 1, 1231, 786, 8, 252, 3963, 7, 34, 1066, 6, 399, 7391, 3, 64, 1060, 122, 31, 0, 6, 7324, 4092, 4010, 127, 214, 4, 17, 141, 142, 535, 71, 297, 1308, 1095, 5, 233, 0, 5, 0, 14, 0, 347, 3572, 3, 0, 5309, 27, 0, 856, 2064, 5, 0, 90, 0, 3453, 1, 1231, 786, 8, 0, 2, 0, 3, 2776, 5376, 10, 97, 10, 1, 3675, 2, 2821, 10, 6, 117, 2, 593, 21, 6222, 976, 14, 1, 1395, 136, 3, 5260, 2521, 4, 1, 326, 1, 0, 2, 1, 318, 299, 16, 6, 6749, 666, 2666, 13, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 7, 615, 5, 0, 17, 28, 548, 1, 1231, 786, 7, 3897, 0, 14, 26, 10076, 3, 14, 1, 0, 0, 2, 17, 3370, 13, 0, 3, 30, 350, 32, 1, 4908]"

Another feature of the French Revolutionary Wars was the effect of British blockade on French movements  The Royal Navy maintained an active close blockade of all major French ports during the conflict  which resulted in every French ship that left port facing attack from squadrons and individual ships patrolling the French and allied coasts  The losses the French Navy suffered as a result of this strategy were high  and the blockade was so effective that even movement between ports along the French coasts was restricted  In the Indian Ocean however the huge distances between the French bases on Runion and Isle de France and the British bases in India meant that close blockade was an ineffective strategy  the scale of the forces required to maintain an effective constant blockade of both islands  as well as the Dutch ports at the Cape of Good Hope and in the Dutch East Indies were too large to be worth their deployment to such a distant part of the world  As a result  the French raiders operating from the Indian Ocean bases were able to travel with more freedom and less risk of interception than those in the Atlantic or Mediterranean,"[158, 923, 2, 1, 257, 2857, 1404, 7, 1, 849, 2, 136, 5828, 9, 257, 2240, 1, 329, 542, 1526, 22, 1148, 463, 5828, 2, 52, 194, 257, 3403, 48, 1, 1516, 24, 1068, 4, 515, 257, 240, 12, 193, 759, 2547, 330, 19, 3550, 3, 959, 339, 0, 1, 257, 3, 1296, 0, 1, 1932, 1, 257, 542, 931, 10, 6, 467, 2, 26, 2435, 21, 135, 3, 1, 5828, 7, 115, 1625, 12, 244, 665, 65, 3403, 148, 1, 257, 0, 7, 3512, 4, 1, 796, 1178, 86, 1, 2778, 6564, 65, 1, 257, 2828, 9, 0, 3, 5920, 223, 504, 3, 1, 136, 2828, 4, 802, 1187, 12, 463, 5828, 7, 22, 7888, 2435, 1, 1420, 2, 1, 312, 736, 5, 2380, 22, 1625, 2698, 5828, 2, 87, 729, 10, 97, 10, 1, 1410, 3403, 16, 1, 1898, 2, 376, 1996, 3, 4, 1, 1410, 170, 3199, 21, 441, 211, 5, 25, 2711, 30, 5965, 5, 81, 6, 4861, 106, 2, 1, 80, 10, 6, 467, 1, 257, 4027, 2077, 19, 1, 796, 1178, 2828, 21, 422, 5, 1340, 13, 54, 1920, 3, 401, 1505, 2, 0, 70, 251, 4, 1, 1140, 39, 2796]"

In Vedic literature  Mitra and Varuna are portrayed as icons of affection and intimate friendship between males  the Sanskrit word mitra means  friend  or  companion    They are depicted riding a shark or crocodile together while bearing tridents  ropes  conch shells and water pots  Sometimes they are portrayed seated side  by  side on a golden chariot drawn by seven swans  Ancient Brahmana texts furthermore associate Mitra and Varuna with the two lunar phases and same  sex relations   Mitra and Varuna  on the other hand  are the two half  moons  the waxing one is Varuna and the waning one is Mitra  During the new  moon night these two meet and when they are thus together they are pleased with a cake offering  Verily  all are pleased and all is obtained by any person knowing this  On that same night  Mitra implants his seed in Varuna and when the moon later wanes  that waning is produced from his seed    Shatapatha Brahmana         Varuna is similarly said to implant his seed in Mitra on the full  moon night for the purpose of securing its future waxing  In Hinduism  the new and full  moon nights are discouraged times for procreation and consequently often associated with citrarata or unusual types of intercourse,"[4, 0, 2165, 0, 3, 0, 29, 2446, 10, 0, 2, 9201, 3, 8653, 3045, 65, 1622, 1, 8192, 1131, 0, 1036, 920, 39, 4408, 36, 29, 2445, 4514, 6, 2474, 39, 0, 434, 55, 3710, 0, 0, 0, 3042, 3, 290, 0, 787, 36, 29, 2446, 6883, 282, 14, 282, 9, 6, 1710, 0, 1755, 14, 397, 0, 1598, 0, 5584, 4102, 4777, 0, 3, 0, 13, 1, 38, 7721, 6835, 3, 149, 1795, 2265, 0, 3, 0, 9, 1, 49, 621, 29, 1, 38, 310, 9728, 1, 0, 35, 15, 0, 3, 1, 0, 35, 15, 0, 48, 1, 43, 2094, 435, 90, 38, 1437, 3, 46, 36, 29, 641, 434, 36, 29, 5264, 13, 6, 9835, 3753, 0, 52, 29, 5264, 3, 52, 15, 2452, 14, 156, 837, 6119, 26, 9, 12, 149, 435, 0, 0, 17, 4082, 4, 0, 3, 46, 1, 2094, 57, 0, 12, 0, 15, 372, 19, 17, 4082, 0, 0, 0, 15, 2338, 119, 5, 0, 17, 4082, 4, 0, 9, 1, 473, 2094, 435, 11, 1, 1761, 2, 8340, 37, 700, 0, 4, 0, 1, 43, 3, 473, 2094, 5721, 29, 9277, 253, 11, 0, 3, 3584, 296, 964, 13, 0, 39, 2443, 1769, 2, 0]"

Apart from the s  process  the latter three isotopes have been synthesized as a result of the r  process  lead   is not produced in this manner because its isobar mercury   is stable  and it is not formed as a decay product of r  process products   The r  process happens in mediums of great electron density  In such conditions  beta decay is blocked  because the high electron density fills all available free electron states up to a Fermi energy which is greater than the energy of nuclear beta decay  But nuclear capture of those free neutrons can still occur  and it causes neutron enrichment of matter  This results an extremely high density of free neutrons which cannot decay  and  correspondingly  a large neutron flux and high temperatures  which is the reason why neutron capture occurs much faster than beta decay  However  the r  process does not directly form as much lead as the s  process  because neutron  rich nuclei with mass numbers    that would decay to lead are not magic  unlike those that reach the closed neutron shell at neutron number  and decay to the platinum group metals around mass number   This effect is nevertheless masked  because these lead isotopes are also located at the end of three major decay chains  see above   they are created by the decay of the heavier elements  which are also created by the r  process  Nuclides with mass numbers between  and  inclusive  as well as  and   polonium through actinium  as well as protactinium   quickly undergo alpha and beta decay to stable lead and bismuth isotopes  However  nuclides with mass numbers  as well as  and above soon decay to the extremely long  lived isotopes of thorium and uranium  which decay very slowly to lead  Hence  the amount of lead in the universe is still slowly increasing,"[2416, 19, 1, 8, 669, 1, 804, 62, 4757, 40, 42, 0, 10, 6, 467, 2, 1, 632, 669, 351, 15, 31, 372, 4, 26, 2341, 132, 37, 0, 5103, 15, 2299, 3, 20, 15, 31, 464, 10, 6, 4974, 2074, 2, 632, 669, 2236, 1, 632, 669, 6093, 4, 0, 2, 258, 4876, 4186, 4, 81, 996, 4563, 4974, 15, 4266, 132, 1, 135, 4876, 4186, 0, 52, 567, 511, 4876, 128, 59, 5, 6, 7160, 952, 24, 15, 1168, 70, 1, 952, 2, 1836, 4563, 4974, 27, 1836, 1446, 2, 251, 511, 8334, 110, 254, 2055, 3, 20, 1989, 6634, 0, 2, 1715, 26, 1426, 22, 2290, 135, 4186, 2, 511, 8334, 24, 1823, 4974, 3, 0, 6, 211, 6634, 0, 3, 135, 3307, 24, 15, 1, 1647, 1881, 6634, 1446, 2207, 189, 3488, 70, 4563, 4974, 86, 1, 632, 669, 599, 31, 1119, 287, 10, 189, 351, 10, 1, 8, 669, 132, 6634, 2520, 0, 13, 954, 1139, 12, 51, 4974, 5, 351, 29, 31, 2688, 1802, 251, 12, 1031, 1, 1329, 6634, 2482, 16, 6634, 95, 3, 4974, 5, 1, 2343, 153, 5544, 152, 954, 95, 26, 849, 15, 1985, 0, 132, 90, 351, 4757, 29, 34, 487, 16, 1, 137, 2, 62, 194, 4974, 6523, 520, 663, 36, 29, 408, 14, 1, 4974, 2, 1, 5647, 731, 24, 29, 34, 408, 14, 1, 632, 669, 0, 13, 954, 1139, 65, 3, 0, 10, 97, 10, 3, 0, 91, 0, 10, 97, 10, 8210, 856, 6946, 2687, 3, 4563, 4974, 5, 2299, 351, 3, 0, 4757, 86, 0, 13, 954, 1139, 10, 97, 10, 3, 663, 512, 4974, 5, 1, 2290, 133, 1129, 4757, 2, 9158, 3, 3484, 24, 4974, 256, 2333, 5, 351, 5098, 1, 1314, 2, 351, 4, 1, 2909, 15, 254, 2333, 1465]"

The white  headed capuchin is regarded as  least concern  from a conservation standpoint by IUCN  However  its numbers are affected by the fact that it is sometimes captured for the pet trade  Its status can also be harmed by deforestation  However  deforestation may also impact its main predator  the harpy eagle  more than it directly impacts the white  headed capuchin  and so on a net basis deforestation may not be as harmful to the capuchin s status  The white  headed capuchin can adapt to forest fragmentation better than other species due to its ability to live in a wide variety of forest types and exploit a wide variety of food sources  The white  headed capuchin is important to its ecosystems as a seed and pollen disperser  It also impacts the ecosystem by eating insects that act as pests to certain trees  by pruning certain trees  such as Gustavia superba and Bursera simaruba  causing them generate more branches and possibly additional fruit  and by accelerating germination of certain seeds when they pass through the capuchin s digestive tract  In addition  the white  headed capuchin sometimes kills Acacia collinsii plants when it rips through the plant s branches to get to resident ant colonies,"[1, 300, 2097, 0, 15, 1648, 10, 571, 2566, 19, 6, 2692, 0, 14, 6976, 86, 37, 1139, 29, 1781, 14, 1, 914, 12, 20, 15, 787, 978, 11, 1, 6915, 888, 37, 962, 110, 34, 25, 0, 14, 0, 86, 0, 76, 34, 906, 37, 226, 6888, 1, 0, 5016, 54, 70, 20, 1119, 8769, 1, 300, 2097, 0, 3, 115, 9, 6, 5184, 1699, 0, 76, 31, 25, 10, 0, 5, 1, 0, 8, 962, 1, 300, 2097, 0, 110, 6377, 5, 1508, 0, 690, 70, 49, 249, 178, 5, 37, 1193, 5, 359, 4, 6, 758, 1074, 2, 1508, 1769, 3, 9463, 6, 758, 1074, 2, 857, 1318, 1, 300, 2097, 0, 15, 544, 5, 37, 0, 10, 6, 4082, 3, 0, 0, 20, 34, 8769, 1, 9902, 14, 4892, 4411, 12, 439, 10, 0, 5, 1082, 1584, 14, 0, 1082, 1584, 81, 10, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1403, 92, 5392, 54, 3902, 3, 1535, 767, 2883, 3, 14, 0, 0, 2, 1082, 5014, 46, 36, 1079, 91, 1, 0, 8, 0, 8755, 4, 496, 1, 300, 2097, 0, 787, 3863, 0, 0, 1847, 46, 20, 0, 91, 1, 1432, 8, 3902, 5, 437, 5, 4287, 5062, 3172]"

Many castles were originally built from earth and timber  but had their defences replaced later by stone  Early castles often exploited natural defences  lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep  In the late th and early th centuries  a scientific approach to castle defence emerged  This led to the proliferation of towers  with an emphasis on flanking fire  Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence  several stages of defence within each other that could all function at the same time to maximise the castle s firepower  These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades  such as concentric fortification  and inspiration from earlier defences  such as Roman forts  Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature  so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power  Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape,"[96, 5275, 21, 474, 266, 19, 1045, 3, 5693, 27, 23, 30, 4099, 661, 57, 14, 679, 105, 5275, 296, 0, 912, 4099, 4941, 493, 81, 10, 4815, 3, 0, 3, 9414, 9, 6, 394, 1021, 4, 1, 214, 66, 3, 105, 66, 1987, 6, 1742, 1471, 5, 622, 1594, 2397, 26, 229, 5, 1, 0, 2, 4815, 13, 22, 4477, 9, 0, 333, 96, 43, 5275, 21, 0, 39, 7176, 9, 0, 1594, 101, 1909, 2, 1594, 261, 147, 49, 12, 123, 52, 2039, 16, 1, 149, 47, 5, 0, 1, 622, 8, 0, 90, 823, 4, 1594, 40, 42, 2591, 5, 6, 4414, 2, 622, 1736, 19, 1, 0, 81, 10, 0, 0, 3, 2461, 19, 630, 4099, 81, 10, 989, 6023, 31, 52, 1, 731, 2, 622, 2102, 21, 328, 4, 886, 115, 12, 4904, 81, 10, 0, 2704, 19, 30, 232, 1761, 2, 1594, 50, 6764, 2, 280, 71, 784, 5275, 23, 133, 0, 4037, 1047, 5, 0, 3, 9783, 30, 3721]"

On a sub  kilometer scale the surface of Callisto is more degraded than the surfaces of other icy Galilean moons  Typically there is a deficit of small impact craters with diameters less than  km as compared with  for instance  the dark plains on Ganymede  Instead of small craters  the almost ubiquitous surface features are small knobs and pits  The knobs are thought to represent remnants of crater rims degraded by an as  yet uncertain process  The most likely candidate process is the slow sublimation of ice  which is enabled by a temperature of up to  K  reached at a subsolar point  Such sublimation of water or other volatiles from the dirty ice that is the bedrock causes its decomposition  The non  ice remnants form debris avalanches descending from the slopes of the crater walls  Such avalanches are often observed near and inside impact craters and termed  debris aprons   Sometimes crater walls are cut by sinuous valley  like incisions called  gullies   which resemble certain Martian surface features  In the ice sublimation hypothesis  the low  lying dark material is interpreted as a blanket of primarily non  ice debris  which originated from the degraded rims of craters and has covered a predominantly icy bedrock,"[9, 6, 3339, 9317, 1420, 1, 870, 2, 0, 15, 54, 0, 70, 1, 7993, 2, 49, 0, 0, 9728, 1768, 69, 15, 6, 9014, 2, 250, 906, 0, 13, 0, 401, 70, 168, 10, 917, 13, 11, 3348, 1, 935, 5527, 9, 0, 381, 2, 250, 0, 1, 541, 0, 870, 493, 29, 250, 0, 3, 7737, 1, 0, 29, 539, 5, 2203, 3839, 2, 9071, 0, 0, 14, 22, 10, 881, 4951, 669, 1, 64, 1060, 2212, 669, 15, 1, 1662, 0, 2, 1007, 24, 15, 6403, 14, 6, 2249, 2, 59, 5, 1605, 412, 16, 6, 0, 283, 81, 0, 2, 290, 39, 49, 0, 19, 1, 8220, 1007, 12, 15, 1, 0, 1989, 37, 0, 1, 566, 1007, 3839, 287, 4737, 0, 7839, 19, 1, 7645, 2, 1, 9071, 1639, 81, 0, 29, 296, 1631, 259, 3, 1088, 906, 0, 3, 6573, 4737, 0, 787, 9071, 1639, 29, 764, 14, 0, 1004, 131, 0, 134, 0, 24, 6139, 1082, 0, 870, 493, 4, 1, 1007, 0, 5473, 1, 447, 3182, 935, 877, 15, 4526, 10, 6, 0, 2, 1350, 566, 1007, 4737, 24, 4337, 19, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 44, 1135, 6, 5456, 0, 0]"

Anamorphic or imperfect fungi are those that seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle  and typically reproduce by the process of mitosis in structures called conidia  In some cases  the sexual stage  or teleomorph stage  is later identified  and a teleomorph  anamorph relationship is established between the species  The International Code of Nomenclature for algae  fungi  and plants permits the recognition of two  or more  names for one and the same organism  one based on the teleomorph  the other  s  restricted to the anamorph  The name of the anamorphic state of S coccinea is Molliardiomyces eucoccinea  first described by Marin Molliard in   Molliard found the growth of the conidia to resemble those of the genera Coryne and Chlorosplenium rather than the Pezizaceae  and he considered that this suggested an affinity between Sarcoscypha and the family Helvellaceae  In   John W Paden again described the anamorph  but like Molliard  failed to give a complete description of the species  In   Paden created a new genus he named Molliardiomyces to contain the anamorphic forms of several Sarcoscypha species  and set Molliardiomyces eucoccinea as the type species  This form produces colorless conidiophores  specialized stalks that bear conidia  that are usually irregularly branched  measuring    by        m  The conidia are ellipsoidal to egg  shaped  smooth  translucent  hyaline   and        by        m  they tend to accumulate in  mucilaginous masses,"[0, 39, 0, 7637, 29, 251, 12, 3421, 5, 946, 6, 1962, 476, 4, 30, 141, 2694, 3, 1768, 9957, 14, 1, 669, 2, 0, 4, 1840, 134, 0, 4, 71, 1294, 1, 1962, 476, 39, 0, 476, 15, 57, 1476, 3, 6, 0, 0, 619, 15, 465, 65, 1, 249, 1, 374, 2472, 2, 0, 11, 0, 7637, 3, 1847, 0, 1, 2326, 2, 38, 39, 54, 1128, 11, 35, 3, 1, 149, 7463, 35, 201, 9, 1, 0, 1, 49, 8, 3512, 5, 1, 0, 1, 205, 2, 1, 0, 102, 2, 8, 0, 15, 0, 0, 28, 243, 14, 0, 0, 4, 0, 155, 1, 1547, 2, 1, 0, 5, 6139, 251, 2, 1, 5276, 0, 3, 0, 470, 70, 1, 0, 3, 18, 305, 12, 26, 748, 22, 7756, 65, 0, 3, 1, 184, 0, 4, 175, 1077, 0, 246, 243, 1, 0, 27, 131, 0, 734, 5, 869, 6, 760, 1641, 2, 1, 249, 4, 0, 408, 6, 43, 1811, 18, 263, 0, 5, 2440, 1, 0, 1107, 2, 101, 0, 249, 3, 187, 0, 0, 10, 1, 750, 249, 26, 287, 5199, 0, 0, 7782, 0, 12, 2523, 0, 12, 29, 807, 0, 0, 5503, 14, 109, 1, 0, 29, 0, 5, 4431, 2258, 3615, 0, 0, 3, 14, 109, 36, 3905, 5, 0, 4, 0, 4944]"

GMAW with globular metal transfer is considered the least desirable of the three major GMAW variations  because of its tendency to produce high heat  a poor weld surface  and spatter  The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW  because this variation uses carbon dioxide  a less expensive shielding gas than argon  Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate  allowing welding speeds of up to  mm  s   in  min   As the weld is made  a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up on the end of the electrode  often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself  When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting  it falls to the workpiece  leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter  As a result of the large molten droplet  the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions  requires thicker workpieces  and results in a larger weld pool,"[0, 13, 0, 1092, 2585, 15, 305, 1, 571, 0, 2, 1, 62, 194, 0, 4239, 132, 2, 37, 6109, 5, 1212, 135, 2242, 6, 965, 0, 870, 3, 0, 1, 2076, 7, 474, 429, 10, 6, 971, 5469, 234, 5, 0, 1743, 356, 0, 132, 26, 4223, 1376, 2732, 6436, 6, 401, 3690, 0, 1677, 70, 0, 2040, 5, 37, 1165, 2048, 7, 37, 135, 0, 1114, 1504, 7016, 6937, 2, 59, 5, 540, 8, 4, 7803, 10, 1, 0, 15, 77, 6, 966, 2, 8082, 1092, 19, 1, 0, 9146, 5, 1353, 59, 9, 1, 137, 2, 1, 0, 296, 4, 6194, 7532, 13, 6, 944, 3018, 70, 1, 0, 763, 46, 1, 0, 854, 0, 537, 14, 4858, 39, 355, 0, 20, 2010, 5, 1, 0, 808, 22, 0, 870, 3, 296, 1403, 0, 10, 6, 467, 2, 1, 211, 8082, 0, 1, 669, 15, 579, 701, 5, 2419, 3, 6651, 7016, 1248, 4182, 0, 0, 3, 1426, 4, 6, 944, 0, 4040]"

Several studies have shown that the spread of Armillaria root rot in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps that remain after an area has been logged  Armillaria luteobubalina can persist on these stumps  using them as a source of food for up to  or more years  In one case reported in Ovens  Victoria  the disease was spread to blueberry plants  Vaccinium species  via buried fragments of infected Eucalyptus that remained following preparation of the previously forested site for planting  In individual forest stands  fungal infection is usually found in discrete disease patches separated by stands of healthy trees  a discontinuous distribution  Large  scale aerial photography can be used to identify regions of forest infected by the species  The species also causes damage to trees and bushes in coastal dune woodlands  shrubland  and heath communities  It can be found on a wide range of hosts  but is most commonly associated with  in order of decreasing frequency  jarrah  Eucalyptus marginata   bull banksia  Banksia grandis   marri  E calophylla   Lasiopetalum floribundum  and Acacia saligna  It has also infected scattered populations of wandoo  E wandoo   The fungus has also been reported to infect Nothofagus species in Argentina  and Pinus radiata in Chile  Armillaria luteobubalina uses  an elaborate  sophisticated aeration system  that enables it to efficiently deliver oxygen into the rhizomorphs  helping it thrive in low  oxygen environments  When grown in culture  the mycelium develops into a continuous region of tissue with a perforated crust  This tissue is hydrophobic and resistant to becoming waterlogged  Rhizomorphs develop beneath clusters of so  called  air  pores  near the perforations  These gas spaces connect the atmosphere with the central canal of the rhizomorph  to facilitate diffusion of oxygen and satiate the organism s high oxygen requirement during growth  This aeration system is thought to be an important factor in the organism s pathogenicity  allowing it to grow on wet or waterlogged root surfaces and send hyphae or rhizomorphs into live roots or cut stumps  where conditions may be hypoxic  The rhizomorphs have a dichotomous branching pattern  so that they split or bifurcate at various intervals  Experiments and field observations have shown that this allows the fungus to be a more aggressive and virulent pathogen than Armillaria species whose rhizomorphs branch monopodially  where lateral branches grow from a main stem   Although the structure of A luteobubalina rhizomorphs is specialised for spread in potentially anaerobic conditions  the soil mycelium is adaptive and can amplify the absorptive surface of peripheral hyphae in response to the presence of nutrient  rich soil,"[101, 1207, 40, 1130, 12, 1, 1967, 2, 0, 5154, 0, 4, 0, 3909, 15, 964, 13, 6539, 0, 12, 1419, 32, 22, 161, 44, 42, 0, 0, 0, 110, 0, 9, 90, 0, 356, 92, 10, 6, 1034, 2, 857, 11, 59, 5, 39, 54, 82, 4, 35, 562, 453, 4, 0, 1371, 1, 1619, 7, 1967, 5, 0, 1847, 0, 249, 902, 2187, 5739, 2, 6539, 0, 12, 393, 118, 2895, 2, 1, 660, 0, 458, 11, 8673, 4, 959, 1508, 2936, 0, 4403, 15, 807, 155, 4, 0, 1619, 9427, 2916, 14, 2936, 2, 8058, 1584, 6, 0, 1841, 211, 1420, 3569, 4098, 110, 25, 99, 5, 3817, 2150, 2, 1508, 6539, 14, 1, 249, 1, 249, 34, 1989, 558, 5, 1584, 3, 0, 4, 1543, 0, 8372, 0, 3, 5885, 2515, 20, 110, 25, 155, 9, 6, 758, 423, 2, 3920, 27, 15, 64, 1828, 964, 13, 4, 275, 2, 0, 4487, 0, 0, 0, 5576, 4973, 4973, 0, 0, 585, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 20, 44, 34, 6539, 4881, 2637, 2, 0, 585, 0, 1, 3957, 44, 34, 42, 453, 5, 0, 0, 249, 4, 4439, 3, 0, 0, 4, 5973, 0, 0, 1376, 22, 5039, 8492, 0, 202, 12, 0, 20, 5, 0, 4315, 3435, 50, 1, 0, 2925, 20, 0, 4, 447, 3435, 6361, 46, 3129, 4, 1053, 1, 0, 6609, 50, 6, 4311, 607, 2, 5809, 13, 6, 0, 0, 26, 5809, 15, 0, 3, 6306, 5, 717, 0, 0, 1649, 3807, 8542, 2, 115, 134, 230, 0, 259, 1, 0, 90, 1677, 5663, 4670, 1, 2669, 13, 1, 394, 1724, 2, 1, 0, 5, 7524, 8363, 2, 3435, 3, 0, 1, 7463, 8, 135, 3435, 4722, 48, 1547, 26, 0, 202, 15, 539, 5, 25, 22, 544, 2613, 4, 1, 7463, 8, 0, 1504, 20, 5, 2539, 9, 4341, 39, 0, 5154, 7993, 3, 2869, 8725, 39, 0, 50, 359, 4028, 39, 764, 0, 78, 996, 76, 25, 0, 1, 0, 40, 6, 0, 0, 2794, 115, 12, 36, 1680, 39, 0, 16, 431, 9623, 3886, 3, 426, 4621, 40, 1130, 12, 26, 2082, 1, 3957, 5, 25, 6, 54, 3528, 3, 0, 0, 70, 0, 249, 713, 0, 1856, 0, 78, 7776, 3902, 2539, 19, 6, 226, 4502, 124, 1, 753, 2, 6, 0, 0, 15, 0, 11, 1967, 4, 5057, 0, 996, 1, 3029, 0, 15, 0, 3, 110, 0, 1, 0, 870, 2, 8647, 8725, 4, 723, 5, 1, 1396, 2, 0, 2520, 3029]"

The solar Eye s volatile nature can make her difficult even for her master to control  In the myth of the  Distant Goddess   a motif with several variants  the Eye goddess becomes upset with Ra and runs away from him  In some versions the provocation for her anger seems to be her replacement with a new eye after the search for Shu and Tefnut  but in others her rebellion seems to take place after the world is fully formed  Dimitri Meeks and Christine Favard  Meeks interpret these events as the Eye s reaction to being deceived by Ra after her slaughter of humanity  whereas Carolyn Graves  Brown sees it as a later elaboration of the myth related in the Book of the Heavenly Cow  With the solar Eye gone  Ra is vulnerable to his enemies and bereft of a large part of his power  The Eye s absence and Ra s weakened state may be a mythological reference to solar eclipses  Moreover  it may be part of a larger motif in Egyptian myth in which a god s Eye is lost and then restored with the help of another deity  This motif also applies to the Eye of Horus  which in the Osiris myth is torn out and must be returned or healed so that Horus may regain his strength,"[1, 2968, 1568, 8, 0, 886, 110, 245, 33, 1126, 244, 11, 33, 1380, 5, 396, 4, 1, 4860, 2, 1, 4861, 3962, 6, 6970, 13, 101, 6341, 1, 1568, 3962, 1149, 4346, 13, 0, 3, 570, 389, 19, 61, 4, 71, 1421, 1, 0, 11, 33, 6710, 2305, 5, 25, 33, 2643, 13, 6, 43, 1568, 32, 1, 1534, 11, 0, 3, 0, 27, 4, 499, 33, 3371, 2305, 5, 298, 198, 32, 1, 80, 15, 1728, 464, 0, 0, 3, 9537, 0, 0, 0, 90, 553, 10, 1, 1568, 8, 1852, 5, 89, 0, 14, 0, 32, 33, 0, 2, 5536, 2586, 0, 6034, 598, 2611, 20, 10, 6, 57, 0, 2, 1, 4860, 1019, 4, 1, 309, 2, 1, 0, 0, 13, 1, 2968, 1568, 2029, 0, 15, 4132, 5, 17, 2721, 3, 0, 2, 6, 211, 106, 2, 17, 280, 1, 1568, 8, 2832, 3, 0, 8, 2008, 102, 76, 25, 6, 0, 1351, 5, 2968, 0, 5530, 20, 76, 25, 106, 2, 6, 944, 6970, 4, 3760, 4860, 4, 24, 6, 702, 8, 1568, 15, 324, 3, 85, 2853, 13, 1, 565, 2, 158, 9356, 26, 6970, 34, 0, 5, 1, 1568, 2, 0, 24, 4, 1, 0, 4860, 15, 7535, 63, 3, 680, 25, 332, 39, 0, 115, 12, 0, 76, 4660, 17, 1472]"

A simple form of directional coupler is two parallel transmission lines coupled together over a    length  This design is limited because the electrical length of the coupler will only be    at one specific frequency  Coupling will be a maximum at this frequency and fall away on either side  Similar to the impedance matching case  this can be improved by using multiple elements  resulting in a filter  like structure  A waveguide analogue of this coupled lines approach is the Bethe  hole directional coupler in which two parallel waveguides are stacked on top of each other and a hole provided for coupling  To produce a wideband design  multiple holes are used along the guides as shown in figure  and a filter design applied  It is not only the coupled  line design that suffers from being narrow band  all simple designs of waveguide coupler depend on frequency in some way  For instance the rat  race coupler  which can be implemented directly in waveguide  works on a completely different principle but still relies on certain lengths being exact in terms of,"[6, 1963, 287, 2, 9394, 0, 15, 38, 2652, 5558, 742, 6021, 434, 56, 6, 900, 26, 385, 15, 701, 132, 1, 5011, 900, 2, 1, 0, 182, 60, 25, 16, 35, 1658, 4487, 0, 182, 25, 6, 1451, 16, 26, 4487, 3, 1122, 389, 9, 537, 282, 348, 5, 1, 0, 8347, 562, 26, 110, 25, 1975, 14, 356, 1257, 731, 1245, 4, 6, 6006, 131, 753, 6, 0, 0, 2, 26, 6021, 742, 1471, 15, 1, 0, 3300, 9394, 0, 4, 24, 38, 2652, 0, 29, 0, 9, 235, 2, 147, 49, 3, 6, 3300, 556, 11, 0, 5, 1212, 6, 0, 385, 1257, 4920, 29, 99, 148, 1, 0, 10, 1130, 4, 1487, 3, 6, 6006, 385, 2301, 20, 15, 31, 60, 1, 6021, 173, 385, 12, 0, 19, 89, 2876, 228, 52, 1963, 2717, 2, 0, 0, 8202, 9, 4487, 4, 71, 234, 11, 3348, 1, 5836, 482, 0, 24, 110, 25, 6588, 1119, 4, 0, 489, 9, 6, 1274, 311, 4016, 27, 254, 0, 9, 1082, 6379, 89, 3923, 4, 1037, 2]"

Phase Shifting Interferometry addresses several issues associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms  Classically  one measures the positions of the fringe centers  As seen in Fig    fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration  Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis  and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error  There is a trade  off between precision and number of data points  closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision  while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points  Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis  all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away  Finally  with static interferograms  additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront  In Fig    one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness  but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex  Traditionally  this information would be obtained using non  automated means  such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed,"[2118, 10050, 0, 7952, 101, 1056, 964, 13, 1, 2619, 1863, 2, 9344, 0, 0, 35, 2463, 1, 1248, 2, 1, 5729, 3391, 10, 488, 4, 9455, 5729, 0, 19, 0, 3, 3089, 0, 843, 6, 2437, 2, 1, 0, 7272, 4, 7061, 1, 1117, 2, 1, 5729, 3391, 843, 1, 0, 2944, 5, 9157, 2, 1, 2619, 1863, 3, 156, 1725, 4239, 421, 1, 0, 182, 34, 6094, 5908, 69, 15, 6, 888, 165, 65, 9157, 3, 95, 2, 1261, 449, 2007, 0, 0, 843, 96, 1261, 449, 2, 447, 9157, 55, 1411, 0, 0, 843, 6, 447, 95, 2, 135, 9157, 1261, 449, 139, 5729, 428, 1261, 15, 52, 12, 35, 1376, 4, 1, 2619, 1863, 52, 2, 1, 49, 1078, 12, 866, 0, 25, 2452, 14, 3102, 1863, 2, 1, 1725, 4239, 4, 22, 0, 15, 4464, 389, 854, 13, 9344, 0, 767, 1078, 15, 988, 5, 2789, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 4, 9455, 35, 110, 520, 12, 1, 4437, 870, 9, 1, 382, 0, 19, 0, 27, 35, 1823, 2195, 19, 26, 174, 1614, 839, 26, 0, 19, 0, 15, 0, 39, 0, 3870, 26, 1078, 51, 25, 2452, 356, 566, 0, 1036, 81, 10, 14, 8689, 1, 1144, 12, 1, 0, 628, 46, 1, 1351, 870, 15, 3398]"

For the    model years  the battery pack stores  kWh of energy but it is controlled or buffered via the energy management system to use only    kWh of this capacity to maximize the life of the pack  For this reason the battery pack never fully charges or depletes  as the software only allows the battery to operate within a state of charge  SOC  window of    after which the engine kicks in and maintains the charge near the lower level  The minimum SOC varies depending on operating conditions  When more power is required  such as mountain mode  the lower limit of the SOC will rise to   to ensure there is enough power available  The battery capacity was increased to    kWh for the  model year  the SOC window will be increased to use    kWh of the total battery energy  and the buffer to ensure battery life will not be reduced  These changes will increase the Volt s all  electric range but charging will take slightly longer  The improved battery performance and durability were achieved through minor changes to the material composition of the battery cell chemistry,"[11, 1, 1044, 82, 1, 1817, 3824, 3117, 0, 2, 952, 27, 20, 15, 1705, 39, 0, 902, 1, 952, 1457, 202, 5, 163, 60, 0, 2, 26, 1752, 5, 0, 1, 141, 2, 1, 3824, 11, 26, 1647, 1, 1817, 3824, 360, 1728, 2123, 39, 0, 10, 1, 3974, 60, 2082, 1, 1817, 5, 2625, 261, 6, 102, 2, 1482, 0, 2931, 2, 32, 24, 1, 1217, 6892, 4, 3, 6920, 1, 1482, 259, 1, 695, 446, 1, 3207, 0, 5997, 3159, 9, 2077, 996, 46, 54, 280, 15, 736, 81, 10, 1293, 1739, 1, 695, 2944, 2, 1, 0, 182, 1708, 5, 5, 3221, 69, 15, 699, 280, 567, 1, 1817, 1752, 7, 596, 5, 0, 11, 1, 1044, 73, 1, 0, 2931, 182, 25, 596, 5, 163, 0, 2, 1, 383, 1817, 952, 3, 1, 0, 5, 3221, 1817, 141, 182, 31, 25, 1186, 90, 823, 182, 942, 1, 8182, 8, 52, 1835, 423, 27, 9644, 182, 298, 1305, 925, 1, 1975, 1817, 363, 3, 0, 21, 1719, 91, 953, 823, 5, 1, 877, 1771, 2, 1, 1817, 1921, 3531]"
