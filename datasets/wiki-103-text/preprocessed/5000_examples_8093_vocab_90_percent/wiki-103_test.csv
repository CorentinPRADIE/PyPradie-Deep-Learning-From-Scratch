The rubber vine could be destructively harvested by cutting up the vine and squeezing out the latex whilst it lay on the ground  This was quicker and easier than non  destructive harvesting and was practised by villagers who wished to fill their quotas and avoid punishment  especially once supplies of the vine began to run low  In addition some vines were destroyed deliberately by villagers who believed that once the rubber was gone Abir would leave the concession  Because of this destruction all rubber vines within  km of Basankasu were depleted within  months of that post opening  In an attempt to slow the destruction of vines Abir issued orders in  and  which prohibited destructive harvesting methods but these were largely ineffective  In  the Congo Free State ordered Abir to plant  rubber trees or vines for each ton of rubber exported to replace destructively harvested vines  This was increased to  plants per ton in   By  the plantation at the Bongandanga post held more than one million plants and by  each Abir post employed around one hundred workers to manage its plantation  Despite this the plantation project was ultimately a failure due in part to the fact that each Abir agent remained at a post for just two years and was uninterested in working the plantation which would only benefit his successor  Congo Free State forestry officers also noted that Abir plantations were smaller than required or even existed only on paper  Abir would also plant vines which looked similar to the Landolphia vine but did not produce rubber  as a consequence the Free State required them to instead plant the Clitandra vine which was more easily recognisable but did not produce rubber in its first eight years  These vines may never have reached maturity as there is no evidence that these plantations ever produced rubber  In  Abir began to run out of vines to tap and rubber production fell to half of that of   which was  tons  By  rubber vines within  miles of Abir posts had been depleting  leading to violent clashes between rival villages over control of the remaining plants  The entirety of the Lulonga concession  to the west of Abir  produced just  tons of rubber in,"[1, 2084, 5610, 118, 25, 0, 0, 14, 3800, 63, 1, 5610, 3, 0, 61, 1, 0, 2237, 20, 2953, 9, 1, 375, 26, 7, 6092, 3, 3819, 62, 642, 8064, 8020, 3, 7, 0, 14, 0, 41, 5327, 5, 5651, 27, 0, 3, 1572, 0, 876, 346, 4007, 2, 1, 5610, 126, 5, 368, 408, 4, 532, 67, 2904, 21, 998, 2960, 14, 0, 41, 503, 12, 346, 1, 2084, 7, 1661, 2667, 51, 1465, 1, 0, 129, 2, 26, 1481, 50, 2084, 2904, 209, 156, 2, 0, 21, 5984, 209, 395, 2, 12, 624, 734, 4, 22, 549, 5, 2145, 1, 1481, 2, 2904, 2667, 849, 3574, 4, 3, 23, 6496, 8064, 8020, 2265, 31, 90, 21, 1119, 0, 4, 1, 5106, 571, 74, 757, 2667, 5, 1513, 2084, 1189, 40, 2904, 10, 125, 5617, 2, 2084, 5522, 5, 2217, 0, 0, 2904, 26, 7, 878, 5, 1315, 374, 5617, 4, 14, 1, 4108, 16, 1, 0, 624, 251, 56, 62, 35, 175, 1315, 3, 14, 125, 2667, 624, 2340, 147, 35, 2182, 1353, 5, 4035, 29, 4108, 268, 26, 1, 4108, 540, 7, 1604, 6, 1563, 225, 4, 92, 5, 1, 693, 12, 125, 2667, 2604, 606, 16, 6, 624, 10, 204, 38, 85, 3, 7, 0, 4, 550, 1, 4108, 23, 51, 69, 2990, 19, 2691, 5106, 571, 74, 4240, 1179, 30, 387, 12, 2667, 4066, 21, 1719, 62, 825, 40, 258, 3923, 69, 9, 1230, 2667, 51, 30, 1513, 2904, 23, 2557, 417, 5, 1, 0, 5610, 31, 122, 36, 982, 2084, 11, 6, 0, 1, 571, 74, 825, 86, 5, 400, 1513, 1, 0, 5610, 23, 7, 56, 3742, 0, 31, 122, 36, 982, 2084, 4, 29, 28, 376, 85, 90, 2904, 72, 326, 39, 454, 5985, 11, 73, 15, 68, 821, 12, 90, 4066, 586, 325, 2084, 4, 2667, 126, 5, 368, 61, 2, 2904, 5, 7261, 3, 2084, 248, 1573, 5, 303, 2, 12, 2, 23, 7, 835, 14, 2084, 2904, 209, 547, 2, 2667, 0, 24, 43, 0, 511, 5, 2512, 0, 71, 2211, 2519, 53, 469, 2, 1, 616, 1315, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 5, 1, 154, 2, 2667, 325, 204, 835, 2, 2084, 4]"
