According to Brothwell  Lindow Man is one of the most complex examples of  overkill  in a bog body  and possibly has ritual meaning as it was  extravagant  for a straightforward murder  Archaeologists John Hodgson and Mark Brennand suggest that bog bodies may have been related to religious practice  although there is division in the academic community over this issue  In the case of Lindow Man  scholars debate whether the killing was murder or done as part of ritual  Anne Ross  an expert on Iron Age religion  proposed that the death was an example of human sacrifice and that the  triple death   throat cut  strangled  and hit on the head  was an offering to several different gods  The wide date range for Lindow Man s death   BC to  AD  means he may have met his demise after the Romans conquered northern England in the s AD  As the Romans outlawed human sacrifice  such timing would open up other possibilities  This conclusion was emphasised by historian Ronald Hutton  who challenged the interpretation of sacrificial death  Connolly suggests that as Lindow Man was found naked  he could have been the victim of a violent robbery,"[279, 5, 0, 5082, 339, 15, 35, 2, 1, 58, 1253, 4220, 2, 0, 4, 6, 0, 735, 3, 1432, 42, 7504, 1331, 11, 20, 7, 0, 10, 6, 0, 1233, 0, 143, 0, 3, 840, 0, 3325, 12, 0, 1738, 72, 39, 43, 1077, 5, 2034, 1043, 146, 73, 15, 259, 4, 1, 2008, 485, 53, 26, 1098, 4, 1, 520, 2, 5082, 339, 2803, 1883, 933, 1, 1313, 7, 1233, 40, 657, 11, 92, 2, 7504, 3131, 2051, 22, 4405, 9, 1343, 365, 1344, 1066, 12, 1, 280, 7, 22, 608, 2, 512, 3694, 3, 12, 1, 4406, 280, 7505, 610, 0, 3, 546, 9, 1, 353, 7, 22, 6048, 5, 99, 286, 4407, 1, 818, 965, 565, 10, 5082, 339, 8, 280, 3847, 5, 2374, 1222, 17, 72, 39, 713, 19, 0, 33, 1, 4408, 7076, 418, 285, 4, 1, 8, 2374, 11, 1, 4408, 6049, 512, 3694, 81, 0, 51, 491, 63, 49, 0, 26, 1992, 7, 0, 14, 2375, 3266, 7506, 41, 2376, 1, 2370, 2, 0, 280, 0, 2277, 12, 11, 5082, 339, 7, 188, 4409, 17, 118, 39, 43, 1, 7193, 2, 6, 2512, 0]"

Finline is a different kind of waveguide technology in which waves in a thin strip of dielectric are constrained by two strips of metallisation  There are a number of possible topological arrangements of the dielectric and metal strips  Finline is a variation of slot  waveguide but in the case of finline the whole structure is enclosed in a metal shield  This has the advantage that  like hollow metal waveguide  no power is lost by radiation  Finline filters can be made by printing a metallisation pattern on to a sheet of dielectric material and then inserting the sheet into the E  plane of a hollow metal waveguide much as is done with insert filters  The metal waveguide forms the shield for the finline waveguide  Resonators are formed by metallising a pattern on to the dielectric sheet  More complex patterns than the simple insert filter of figure  are easily achieved because the designer does not have to consider the effect on mechanical support of removing metal  This complexity does not add to the manufacturing costs since the number of processes needed does not change when more elements are added to the design  Finline designs are less sensitive to manufacturing tolerances than insert filters and have wide bandwidths,"[4454, 15, 6, 286, 1185, 2, 3499, 2156, 4, 23, 4233, 4, 6, 3891, 2150, 2, 5152, 32, 0, 14, 38, 2860, 2, 0, 73, 32, 6, 105, 2, 630, 0, 3892, 2, 1, 5152, 3, 700, 2860, 4454, 15, 6, 4429, 2, 3773, 3499, 31, 4, 1, 520, 2, 4454, 1, 971, 733, 15, 7630, 4, 6, 700, 1988, 26, 42, 1, 3115, 12, 128, 5153, 700, 3499, 68, 254, 15, 309, 14, 1325, 4454, 3157, 106, 25, 80, 14, 7631, 6, 0, 2861, 9, 5, 6, 4453, 2, 5152, 944, 3, 112, 0, 1, 4453, 52, 1, 574, 3500, 2, 6, 5153, 700, 3499, 213, 11, 15, 657, 13, 6139, 3157, 1, 700, 3499, 1345, 1, 1988, 10, 1, 4454, 3499, 7632, 32, 429, 14, 0, 6, 2861, 9, 5, 1, 5152, 4453, 56, 1253, 4191, 62, 1, 1688, 6139, 2862, 2, 1245, 32, 3742, 1903, 129, 1, 2344, 515, 36, 39, 5, 4851, 1, 690, 9, 2537, 420, 2, 6140, 700, 26, 5154, 515, 36, 2850, 5, 1, 3158, 2092, 161, 1, 105, 2, 6141, 852, 515, 36, 709, 47, 56, 595, 32, 452, 5, 1, 351, 4454, 2389, 32, 455, 0, 5, 3158, 0, 62, 6139, 3157, 3, 39, 818, 0]"
A major crisis gripped the ACLU in  when a debate erupted over whether to defend Benjamin Spock and the Boston Five against federal charges that they encouraged draftees to avoid the draft  The ACLU board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists  half the board harbored anti  war sentiments  and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources to the cause of the Boston Five  The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake  and the ACLU would be taking a political stance  Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial  and provided legal advice without regard to the political views of the defendants  The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti  war activists  without endorsing the activist s political views  Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case  After the Kent State shootings in   ACLU leaders took another step towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam war  The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments  including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal,"[6, 194, 2007, 0, 1, 1914, 4, 47, 6, 1883, 7633, 53, 933, 5, 1628, 1765, 3501, 3, 1, 1546, 160, 104, 770, 3159, 12, 37, 2085, 0, 5, 1572, 1, 1140, 1, 1914, 504, 7, 3854, 1486, 53, 933, 5, 1628, 1, 2950, 303, 1, 504, 0, 653, 87, 0, 3, 558, 12, 1, 1914, 415, 0, 29, 2611, 5, 1, 935, 2, 1, 1546, 160, 1, 49, 303, 2, 1, 504, 503, 12, 742, 6142, 21, 36, 16, 0, 3, 1, 1914, 51, 25, 646, 6, 362, 0, 728, 1, 1883, 7, 1, 0, 1914, 1504, 12, 20, 7, 7634, 0, 3, 538, 784, 5720, 361, 4154, 5, 1, 362, 2219, 2, 1, 0, 1, 504, 741, 1001, 5, 6, 5155, 4455, 12, 6143, 1, 1914, 5, 1628, 1, 653, 87, 2950, 361, 0, 1, 5099, 8, 362, 2219, 67, 474, 2, 1, 1914, 3325, 12, 1, 1914, 97, 6, 5697, 362, 1032, 117, 1, 3501, 520, 33, 1, 1664, 74, 7006, 4, 1914, 1881, 163, 186, 1964, 432, 2046, 14, 1538, 6, 3006, 0, 1, 1287, 87, 1, 3006, 7, 174, 4, 6, 1044, 2, 784, 7635, 100, 742, 6142, 0, 3, 6, 1586, 12, 1, 87, 7, 5934]"

Some parts of the State Apartments were completely destroyed in the  fire and this area was rebuilt in a style called  Downesian Gothic   named after the architect  Giles Downes  The style comprises  the rather stripped  cool and systematic coherence of modernism sewn into a reinterpretation of the Gothic tradition   Downes argues that the style avoids  florid decoration   emphasising an organic  flowing Gothic structure  Three new rooms were built or remodelled by Downes at Windsor  Downes  new roof of St George s Hall is the largest green  oak structure built since the Middle Ages  and is decorated with brightly coloured shields celebrating the heraldic element of the Order of the Garter  the design attempts to create an illusion of additional height through the gothic woodwork along the ceiling  The Lantern Lobby features flowing oak columns forming a vaulted ceiling  imitating an arum lily  The new Private Chapel is relatively small  only able to fit thirty worshippers  but combines architectural elements of the St George s Hall roof with the Lantern Lobby and the stepped arch structure of the Henry VIII chapel vaulting at Hampton Court  The result is an  extraordinary  continuous and closely moulded net of tracery   complementing the new stained glass windows commemorating the fire  designed by Joseph Nuttgen  The Great Kitchen  with its newly exposed th  century roof lantern sitting alongside Wyatville s fireplaces  chimneys and Gothic tables  is also a product of the reconstruction after the fire,"[67, 729, 2, 1, 74, 5212, 21, 1309, 998, 4, 1, 269, 3, 26, 135, 7, 2886, 4, 6, 473, 139, 0, 3184, 260, 33, 1, 3527, 0, 6246, 1, 473, 7765, 1, 437, 5213, 4508, 3, 7766, 0, 2, 0, 0, 52, 6, 0, 2, 1, 3184, 1504, 6246, 6247, 12, 1, 473, 0, 0, 7745, 0, 22, 7412, 4509, 3184, 733, 54, 46, 1244, 21, 329, 40, 0, 14, 6246, 16, 4490, 6246, 46, 1962, 2, 231, 514, 8, 551, 15, 1, 755, 706, 4510, 733, 329, 161, 1, 777, 2759, 3, 15, 3937, 13, 0, 4878, 0, 5214, 1, 7767, 2802, 2, 1, 255, 2, 1, 5215, 1, 351, 1424, 5, 926, 22, 4950, 2, 597, 3072, 110, 1, 3184, 0, 150, 1, 2810, 1, 4511, 5630, 388, 4509, 4510, 4512, 2740, 6, 6248, 2810, 7768, 22, 0, 6249, 1, 46, 964, 2234, 15, 1533, 250, 69, 467, 5, 3185, 1350, 0, 31, 0, 3186, 595, 2, 1, 231, 514, 8, 551, 1962, 13, 1, 4511, 5630, 3, 1, 5628, 0, 733, 2, 1, 557, 6250, 2234, 0, 16, 7715, 233, 1, 354, 15, 22, 0, 3292, 3, 1850, 0, 6251, 2, 0, 0, 1, 46, 0, 1725, 2137, 0, 1, 269, 489, 14, 1473, 0, 1, 246, 5196, 13, 29, 2225, 2149, 79, 183, 1962, 4511, 2170, 921, 0, 8, 0, 5216, 3, 3184, 0, 15, 30, 6, 2319, 2, 1, 3516, 33, 1, 269]"

The morphology of the cheetah differs notably from the other big cats  The face and the jaw are unusually shortened and the sagittal crest is poorly developed  possibly to reduce weight and enhance speed  In fact  the skull resembles that of the smaller cats  Another point of similarity to the small cats is the long and flexible spine  in contrast to the stiff and short one of other large felids  A  study of felid morphology stated that the truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in the cheetah at a relatively younger age than other felids could be a major reason for the peculiar morphology of the cheetah  Interestingly  the cheetah appears to show convergent evolution with canids in morphology as well as behaviour  For example  the cheetah has a relatively long snout  long legs and deep chest  tough foot pads and blunt  semi  retractable claws  moreover  its hunting behaviour resembles that of canids  In the  study  it was observed that the claws of cheetah have features intermediate between those of felids and the wolf  In the Puma lineage  the cheetah s skull morphology is similar to that of the puma  both have short  wide skulls  while that of the jaguarundi is different,"[1, 3944, 2, 1, 1808, 7801, 2236, 18, 1, 49, 719, 4521, 1, 980, 3, 1, 6281, 32, 3452, 7026, 3, 1, 0, 5750, 15, 3945, 482, 1432, 5, 2485, 1360, 3, 4263, 488, 4, 693, 1, 3540, 5234, 12, 2, 1, 1719, 4521, 186, 356, 2, 0, 5, 1, 250, 4521, 15, 1, 136, 3, 0, 7802, 4, 1407, 5, 1, 0, 3, 367, 35, 2, 49, 249, 7803, 6, 910, 2, 0, 3944, 345, 12, 1, 0, 2, 1, 299, 2, 1, 777, 0, 2825, 4, 1, 1808, 16, 6, 1533, 1544, 365, 62, 49, 7803, 118, 25, 6, 194, 2882, 10, 1, 0, 3944, 2, 1, 1808, 0, 1, 1808, 730, 5, 137, 0, 2035, 13, 0, 4, 3944, 11, 108, 11, 3541, 10, 608, 1, 1808, 42, 6, 1533, 136, 6282, 136, 2284, 3, 1087, 6283, 3010, 2338, 0, 3, 7099, 2094, 0, 7794, 6081, 29, 3195, 3541, 5234, 12, 2, 0, 4, 1, 910, 20, 7, 2330, 12, 1, 7794, 2, 1808, 39, 388, 7804, 71, 239, 2, 7803, 3, 1, 5235, 4, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1808, 8, 3540, 3944, 15, 417, 5, 12, 2, 1, 0, 93, 39, 367, 818, 0, 59, 12, 2, 1, 0, 15, 286]"
Reports suggest that imbalance of brain metal homeostasis may be a cause of PrPSc  associated neurotoxicity  though the underlying mechanisms are difficult to explain based on existing information  Proposed hypotheses include a functional role for PrPC in metal metabolism  and loss of this function due to aggregation to the disease  associated PrPSc form as the cause of brain metal imbalance  Other views suggest gain of toxic function by PrPSc due to sequestration of PrPC  associated metals within the aggregates  resulting in the generation of redox  active PrPSc complexes  The physiological implications of some PrPC  metal interactions are known  while others are still unclear  The pathological implications of PrPC  metal interaction include metal  induced oxidative damage  and in some instances conversion of PrPC to a PrPSc  like form,"[1236, 3325, 12, 0, 2, 3139, 700, 0, 72, 25, 6, 935, 2, 5236, 736, 0, 342, 1, 6284, 0, 32, 1293, 5, 2581, 174, 9, 2021, 1452, 1066, 0, 340, 6, 5237, 282, 10, 5238, 4, 700, 7805, 3, 1225, 2, 26, 1512, 225, 5, 7806, 5, 1, 1867, 736, 5236, 278, 11, 1, 935, 2, 3139, 700, 0, 49, 2219, 3325, 2801, 2, 7807, 1512, 14, 5236, 225, 5, 0, 2, 5238, 736, 4522, 209, 1, 0, 1410, 4, 1, 1691, 2, 0, 1537, 5236, 0, 1, 0, 4848, 2, 67, 5238, 700, 7808, 32, 127, 59, 525, 32, 284, 6045, 1, 7809, 4848, 2, 5238, 700, 2468, 340, 700, 3164, 0, 370, 3, 4, 67, 0, 2983, 2, 5238, 5, 6, 5236, 128, 278]"

Measurements of the interaction between energetic photons and hadrons show that the interaction is much more intense than expected by the interaction of merely photons with the hadron s electric charge  Furthermore  the interaction of energetic photons with protons is similar to the interaction of photons with neutrons in spite of the fact that the electric charge structures of protons and neutrons are substantially different  A theory called Vector Meson Dominance  VMD  was developed to explain this effect  According to VMD  the photon is a superposition of the pure electromagnetic photon which interacts only with electric charges and vector meson  However  if experimentally probed at very short distances  the intrinsic structure of the photon is recognized as a flux of quark and gluon components  quasi  free according to asymptotic freedom in QCD and described by the photon structure function  A comprehensive comparison of data with theoretical predictions is presented in a recent review,"[0, 2, 1, 2468, 71, 0, 6302, 3, 0, 137, 12, 1, 2468, 15, 213, 56, 2500, 62, 1383, 14, 1, 2468, 2, 4392, 6302, 13, 1, 0, 8, 1737, 1172, 4528, 1, 2468, 2, 0, 6302, 13, 7832, 15, 417, 5, 1, 2468, 2, 6302, 13, 6303, 4, 0, 2, 1, 693, 12, 1, 1737, 1172, 3172, 2, 7832, 3, 6303, 32, 0, 286, 6, 1323, 139, 0, 0, 5900, 0, 7, 482, 5, 2581, 26, 690, 279, 5, 0, 1, 6304, 15, 6, 0, 2, 1, 3290, 0, 6304, 23, 0, 69, 13, 1737, 3159, 3, 0, 0, 83, 164, 0, 0, 16, 247, 367, 0, 1, 6185, 733, 2, 1, 6304, 15, 2365, 11, 6, 6305, 2, 0, 3, 0, 3772, 0, 571, 279, 5, 0, 1905, 4, 0, 3, 257, 14, 1, 6304, 733, 1512, 6, 6306, 3548, 2, 1874, 13, 0, 7833, 15, 1221, 4, 6, 1237, 508]"

A consideration of a hypothetical random genetic code further motivates a biochemical or evolutionary model for the origin of the genetic code  If amino acids were randomly assigned to triplet codons  there would be      possible genetic codes to choose from  This number is found by calculating how many ways there are to place  items   amino acids plus one stop  in  bins  wherein each item is used at least once     In fact  the distribution of codon assignments in the genetic code is nonrandom  In particular  the genetic code clusters certain amino acid assignments  For example  amino acids that share the same biosynthetic pathway tend to have the same first base in their codons  This could be an evolutionary relic of early simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids  that later diverged to code for a larger set of amino acids  It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had and other effect on the codon during its evolution  Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons  reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations,"[6, 3885, 2, 6, 0, 3974, 2359, 1901, 273, 0, 6, 0, 40, 5966, 1378, 10, 1, 1448, 2, 1, 2359, 1901, 164, 2911, 3211, 21, 0, 807, 5, 0, 7907, 73, 51, 25, 630, 2359, 4562, 5, 3557, 18, 26, 105, 15, 188, 14, 0, 449, 98, 1965, 73, 32, 5, 219, 1384, 2911, 3211, 2912, 35, 1447, 4, 7908, 6356, 125, 6357, 15, 88, 16, 545, 346, 4, 693, 1, 1168, 2, 0, 0, 4, 1, 2359, 1901, 15, 0, 4, 1125, 1, 2359, 1901, 5848, 1136, 2911, 3975, 0, 10, 608, 2911, 3211, 12, 1975, 1, 149, 0, 0, 3558, 5, 39, 1, 149, 28, 725, 4, 27, 7907, 26, 118, 25, 22, 5966, 0, 2, 109, 7909, 2359, 1901, 13, 2704, 2911, 3211, 12, 55, 7109, 5, 1901, 10, 6, 1781, 221, 2, 2911, 3211, 20, 118, 30, 3792, 0, 3, 2405, 3082, 12, 24, 3, 49, 690, 9, 1, 0, 45, 29, 2035, 2911, 3211, 13, 417, 1793, 3082, 30, 3558, 5, 39, 417, 7907, 3015, 1, 615, 384, 14, 356, 0, 3, 0]"

Although Rgnvaldr was likely the sea  king who assisted the Scots against Haraldr  there is evidence suggesting that it may have been Ragnall instead  For example  the saga makes the erroneous statement that Rgnvaldr was descended from Ingibjrg Plsdttir  a woman who was much more likely to have been Ragnall s grandmother than Rgnvaldr s  The saga also notes that Rgnvaldr s military force was partly gathered from Kintyre  which may be more likely of Ragnall than Rgnvaldr  since Ragnall is known to have specifically styled himself dominus Ergile et Kyntyre  Also  transcriptions and translations of Howden s account of the episode have generally stated that  Reginaldus  was a son of Somairle  A recent reanalysis of the main extant version of Howden s chronicle has shown  however  that this particular part of the text originally read in Latin Reginaldus filius rex de Man  and was later altered to include Somairle s name above the last three words  Since the source of the original manuscript probably read in Latin Reginaldus filius Godredi  the sea  king in question appears to have been Rgnvaldr rather than Ragnall,"[146, 4659, 7, 1226, 1, 371, 288, 41, 1887, 1, 4763, 104, 0, 73, 15, 821, 4192, 12, 20, 72, 39, 43, 5434, 400, 10, 608, 1, 3731, 1156, 1, 0, 2099, 12, 4659, 7, 0, 18, 0, 0, 6, 969, 41, 7, 213, 56, 1226, 5, 39, 43, 5434, 8, 5218, 62, 4659, 8, 1, 3731, 30, 846, 12, 4659, 8, 341, 302, 7, 3734, 3579, 18, 0, 23, 72, 25, 56, 1226, 2, 5434, 62, 4659, 161, 5434, 15, 127, 5, 39, 2574, 0, 377, 0, 0, 3998, 0, 30, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 8, 947, 2, 1, 133, 39, 541, 345, 12, 0, 7, 6, 441, 2, 0, 6, 1237, 0, 2, 1, 208, 0, 298, 2, 0, 8, 4140, 42, 1135, 83, 12, 26, 1125, 92, 2, 1, 1700, 444, 1454, 4, 1261, 0, 0, 6117, 185, 339, 3, 7, 55, 3403, 5, 340, 0, 8, 178, 918, 1, 296, 54, 1690, 161, 1, 868, 2, 1, 223, 5959, 924, 1454, 4, 1261, 0, 0, 0, 1, 371, 288, 4, 1972, 730, 5, 39, 43, 4659, 437, 62, 5434]"

Another explanation for Stegosaurus plates  heavily vascular design is that  when under threat  blood could rush into the plates  causing them to  blush  which would add a colorful  red warning   embellishing  the visual threat display  This  blushing capacity   instead of thermoregulatory functions  may be the plates  purpose  though the two functions certainly could have coexisted  That Stegosaurus plates could  blush  has become the predominant interpretation of plate function since the late th century  and is even depicted in the popular BBC documentary Walking with Dinosaurs  with the sudden reddening of the plates used in conjunction with threatening swings of the spiked tail to intimidate and confuse an attacking Allosaurus  Also  this blushing could have been used to attract mates  A study published in  supports the idea of their use in species identification  Researchers believe this may be the function of other unique anatomical features  found in various dinosaur species,"[186, 7821, 10, 0, 3213, 1541, 0, 351, 15, 12, 47, 120, 2302, 857, 118, 2868, 52, 1, 3213, 1283, 86, 5, 0, 23, 51, 2850, 6, 0, 490, 1371, 0, 1, 1088, 2302, 1445, 26, 0, 1228, 400, 2, 0, 3238, 72, 25, 1, 3213, 2632, 342, 1, 38, 3238, 6333, 118, 39, 0, 12, 0, 3213, 118, 0, 42, 372, 1, 0, 2370, 2, 3942, 1512, 161, 1, 218, 79, 183, 3, 15, 258, 2800, 4, 1, 578, 1173, 2490, 3031, 13, 4040, 13, 1, 3392, 0, 2, 1, 3213, 88, 4, 5899, 13, 6219, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1659, 5, 0, 3, 0, 22, 2852, 0, 30, 26, 0, 118, 39, 43, 88, 5, 5435, 0, 6, 910, 389, 4, 0, 1, 732, 2, 27, 145, 4, 214, 6309, 3804, 2364, 26, 72, 25, 1, 1512, 2, 49, 2554, 0, 388, 188, 4, 501, 6567, 214]"

Data processing begins with indexing the reflections  This means identifying the dimensions of the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space  A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal  ie  its space group  Some space groups can be eliminated from the beginning  For example  reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules  thus  only  space groups of  possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral  Indexing is generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine  Having assigned symmetry  the data is then integrated  This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file  consisting of  at the very least  records of the Miller index of each reflection  and an intensity for each reflection  at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of partiality  what part of a given reflection was recorded on that image,"[1874, 5199, 1527, 13, 0, 1, 7955, 26, 1222, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1038, 2836, 3, 23, 1166, 983, 7270, 5, 23, 328, 4, 4765, 679, 6, 0, 2, 0, 15, 5, 2835, 1, 0, 2, 1, 5801, 6244, 29, 679, 151, 67, 679, 572, 106, 25, 4806, 18, 1, 696, 10, 608, 3102, 0, 2819, 25, 2330, 4, 0, 4664, 602, 69, 679, 572, 2, 630, 32, 648, 10, 3566, 4664, 23, 32, 637, 1206, 0, 0, 15, 541, 5406, 338, 22, 0, 4374, 315, 807, 0, 1, 1874, 15, 112, 4866, 26, 7278, 1, 1902, 2, 2038, 2223, 1, 1417, 2, 7955, 52, 6, 181, 5443, 2991, 2, 16, 1, 247, 545, 599, 2, 1, 2173, 4214, 2, 125, 3102, 3, 22, 2127, 10, 125, 3102, 16, 26, 74, 1, 5443, 347, 30, 765, 5313, 5208, 3, 3035, 2, 0, 197, 92, 2, 6, 314, 3102, 7, 277, 9, 12, 1166]"

Absorption filters dissipate the energy in unwanted frequencies internally as heat  This is in contrast to a conventional filter design where the unwanted frequencies are reflected back from the input port of the filter  Such filters are used where it is undesirable for power to be sent back towards the source  This is the case with high power transmitters where returning power can be high enough to damage the transmitter  An absorption filter may be used to remove transmitter spurious emissions such as harmonics or spurious sidebands  A design that has been in use for some time has slots cut in the walls of the feed waveguide at regular intervals  This design is known as a leaky  wave filter  Each slot is connected to a smaller gauge waveguide which is too small to support propagation of frequencies in the wanted band  Thus those frequencies are unaffected by the filter  Higher frequencies in the unwanted band  however  readily propagate along the side guides which are terminated with a matched load where the power is absorbed  These loads are usually a wedge shaped piece of microwave absorbent material  Another  more compact  design of absorption filter uses resonators with a lossy dielectric,"[2641, 3157, 0, 1, 776, 4, 0, 5503, 0, 11, 3301, 26, 15, 4, 1407, 5, 6, 2777, 2862, 351, 91, 1, 0, 5503, 32, 3265, 138, 18, 1, 5504, 584, 2, 1, 2862, 81, 3157, 32, 88, 91, 20, 15, 0, 10, 254, 5, 25, 426, 138, 432, 1, 868, 26, 15, 1, 520, 13, 134, 254, 0, 91, 1177, 254, 106, 25, 134, 649, 5, 370, 1, 0, 22, 2641, 2862, 72, 25, 88, 5, 2488, 0, 0, 6596, 81, 11, 0, 40, 0, 0, 6, 351, 12, 42, 43, 4, 145, 10, 67, 48, 42, 0, 610, 4, 1, 1549, 2, 1, 2240, 3499, 16, 812, 0, 26, 351, 15, 127, 11, 6, 0, 1574, 2862, 125, 3773, 15, 3536, 5, 6, 1719, 0, 3499, 23, 15, 604, 250, 5, 420, 0, 2, 5503, 4, 1, 591, 159, 602, 239, 5503, 32, 0, 14, 1, 2862, 981, 5503, 4, 1, 0, 159, 83, 0, 0, 150, 1, 307, 0, 23, 32, 0, 13, 6, 5100, 3039, 91, 1, 254, 15, 0, 90, 0, 32, 900, 6, 0, 3274, 1632, 2, 0, 0, 944, 186, 56, 6710, 351, 2, 2641, 2862, 1470, 7632, 13, 6, 0, 5152]"

The analysis above assumes that each key s hash is a random number independent of the hashes of all the other keys  This assumption is unrealistic for most applications of hashing  However  random or pseudorandom hash values may be used when hashing objects by their identity rather than by their value  For instance  this is done using linear probing by the IdentityHashMap class of the Java collections framework  The hash value that this class associates with each object  its identityHashCode  is guaranteed to remain fixed for the lifetime of an object but is otherwise arbitrary  Because the identityHashCode is constructed only once per object  and is not required to be related to the object s address or value  its construction may involve slower computations such as the call to a random or pseudorandom number generator  For instance  Java  uses an Xorshift pseudorandom number generator to construct these values,"[1, 1296, 918, 0, 12, 125, 1074, 8, 0, 15, 6, 3974, 105, 1027, 2, 1, 0, 2, 50, 1, 49, 2294, 26, 0, 15, 7571, 10, 58, 3769, 2, 0, 83, 3974, 40, 0, 0, 2348, 72, 25, 88, 47, 0, 3614, 14, 27, 2212, 437, 62, 14, 27, 1864, 10, 4514, 26, 15, 657, 338, 2898, 0, 14, 1, 0, 363, 2, 1, 0, 4001, 6400, 1, 0, 1864, 12, 26, 363, 4413, 13, 125, 3391, 29, 0, 15, 0, 5, 1534, 5962, 10, 1, 4185, 2, 22, 3391, 31, 15, 1951, 0, 129, 1, 0, 15, 1746, 69, 346, 374, 3391, 3, 15, 36, 825, 5, 25, 1077, 5, 1, 3391, 8, 2785, 40, 1864, 29, 533, 72, 5757, 6750, 0, 81, 11, 1, 1126, 5, 6, 3974, 40, 0, 105, 5515, 10, 4514, 0, 1470, 22, 0, 0, 105, 5515, 5, 5391, 90, 2348]"

Suillus collinitus is the most frequent fungus associating with Aleppo pine  a hardy tree utilised for reforestation schemes and soil conservation against erosion in the Mediterranean region  A study performed in the south of France discovered that S collinitus and S mediterraneensis are multi  stage ectomycorrhizal fungi  associating with both young and mature stands of Aleppo pine  These two species may play a key role in the survival and adaptation of this species of pine on disturbed calcareous sites  Roots mycorrhizal with S collinitus were found capable of surviving successive disturbances by fire or ploughing  Moreover  the fungus retained its viability to propagate via its mycelial network which helped the recolonisation effort of newly introduced trees  The fungus has also been shown to improve the growth of Mediterranean pines grown in greenhouses and nurseries  Unlike other Suillus species that grow in wet climates  such as S grevillei and S spraguei  S collinitus does not typically produce fruit bodies in young plantations  This fruiting behaviour may be attributed to the typically nutrient  poor xeric Mediterranean environment in combination with a lack of tree canopy  The absence of above  ground indicators of fungal presence makes analysis of underground populations difficult  molecular markers have been developed to assist in monitoring fungal growth and ectomycorrhizal formation and persistence in young plantations,"[0, 6810, 15, 1, 58, 3439, 3248, 0, 13, 0, 1666, 6, 4468, 1456, 0, 10, 0, 4436, 3, 3368, 2640, 104, 6395, 4, 1, 2396, 544, 6, 910, 404, 4, 1, 116, 2, 476, 1288, 12, 8, 6810, 3, 8, 0, 32, 2358, 517, 0, 0, 0, 13, 93, 435, 3, 4572, 2006, 2, 0, 1666, 90, 38, 214, 72, 276, 6, 1074, 282, 4, 1, 5506, 3, 2562, 2, 26, 214, 2, 1666, 9, 0, 0, 2210, 4262, 0, 13, 8, 6810, 21, 188, 4342, 2, 3187, 4362, 0, 14, 269, 40, 0, 6081, 1, 3248, 2020, 29, 0, 5, 0, 749, 29, 0, 1204, 23, 853, 1, 0, 893, 2, 2225, 1011, 1189, 1, 3248, 42, 30, 43, 1135, 5, 2129, 1, 1286, 2, 2396, 0, 3201, 4, 0, 3, 0, 3051, 49, 0, 214, 12, 2903, 4, 7464, 0, 81, 11, 8, 0, 3, 8, 0, 8, 6810, 515, 36, 1578, 982, 4005, 1738, 4, 435, 4066, 26, 0, 3541, 72, 25, 3351, 5, 1, 1578, 5850, 1176, 0, 2396, 1606, 4, 2271, 13, 6, 943, 2, 1456, 6313, 1, 5638, 2, 918, 375, 0, 2, 0, 2003, 1156, 1296, 2, 3450, 4264, 1293, 4404, 0, 39, 43, 482, 5, 2279, 4, 4795, 0, 1286, 3, 0, 844, 3, 0, 4, 435, 4066]"

One of the greatest differences between the solitary and gregarious phases is behavioural  The gregaria nymphs are attracted to each other  this being seen as early as the second instar  They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals  These groups behave like cohesive units and move across the landscape  mostly downhill  but making their way round barriers and merging with other bands  The attraction between the insects seems to be largely visual  but also involves olfactory cues  and the band seem to navigate using the sun  They pause to feed at intervals before resuming their march  and may cover tens of kilometres over a few weeks  There are also differences in morphology and development  In the desert locust and the migratory locust for example  the gregaria nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings  they grow larger and have a longer developmental period  The adults are larger with different body proportions  less sexual dimorphism and a higher metabolic rate  They mature more rapidly and start reproducing earlier but have a lower level of fecundity,"[35, 2, 1, 973, 2244, 71, 1, 0, 3, 0, 5800, 15, 0, 1, 0, 0, 32, 1758, 5, 125, 49, 26, 94, 529, 11, 109, 11, 1, 75, 0, 37, 674, 278, 1377, 2, 98, 1417, 2, 2224, 90, 572, 0, 128, 0, 731, 3, 826, 451, 1, 2937, 1006, 0, 31, 448, 27, 242, 639, 0, 3, 6298, 13, 49, 1377, 1, 3980, 71, 1, 5233, 2163, 5, 25, 1119, 1088, 31, 30, 7996, 7651, 0, 3, 1, 159, 3964, 5, 0, 338, 1, 1388, 37, 0, 5, 2240, 16, 0, 65, 0, 27, 195, 3, 72, 431, 0, 2, 1875, 53, 6, 330, 405, 73, 32, 30, 2244, 4, 3944, 3, 299, 4, 1, 3748, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 10, 608, 1, 0, 0, 372, 5076, 13, 2089, 0, 3615, 3, 352, 0, 37, 2903, 1781, 3, 39, 6, 1751, 5558, 401, 1, 2719, 32, 1781, 13, 286, 735, 0, 455, 2040, 0, 3, 6, 981, 0, 1062, 37, 4572, 56, 2761, 3, 556, 0, 655, 31, 39, 6, 810, 555, 2, 0]"

Californium is one of the few transuranium elements that have practical applications  Most of these applications exploit the property of certain isotopes of californium to emit neutrons  For example  californium can be used to help start up nuclear reactors  and it is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials with neutron diffraction and neutron spectroscopy  Californium can also be used in nuclear synthesis of higher mass elements  ununoctium  element   was synthesized by bombarding californium   atoms with calcium   ions  Users of californium must take into account radiological concerns and the element s ability to disrupt the formation of red blood cells by bioaccumulating in skeletal tissue,"[4736, 15, 35, 2, 1, 330, 0, 595, 12, 39, 6165, 3769, 58, 2, 90, 3769, 5653, 1, 1123, 2, 1136, 0, 2, 4736, 5, 0, 6303, 10, 608, 4736, 106, 25, 88, 5, 590, 556, 63, 1458, 0, 3, 20, 15, 2340, 11, 6, 868, 2, 6303, 47, 3503, 3396, 13, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4736, 106, 30, 25, 88, 4, 1458, 6260, 2, 981, 832, 595, 0, 2802, 7, 6444, 14, 0, 4736, 3565, 13, 0, 0, 2202, 2, 4736, 929, 310, 52, 947, 0, 2183, 3, 1, 2802, 8, 1496, 5, 0, 1, 844, 2, 490, 857, 3834, 14, 0, 4, 0, 0]"

Opinion amongst modern historians is also split  for instance  Fine accepts the concept of the Peace of Callias  whereas Sealey effectively rejects it  Holland accepts that some kind of accommodation was made between Athens and Persia  but no actual treaty  Fine argues that Callisthenes s denial that a treaty was made after the Eurymedon does not preclude a peace being made at another point  Further  he suggests that Theopompus was actually referring to a treaty that had allegedly been negotiated with Persia in  BC  If these views are correct  it would remove one major obstacle to the acceptance of the treaty s existence  A further argument for the existence of the treaty is the sudden withdrawal of the Athenians from Cyprus in  BC  which makes most sense in the light of some kind of peace agreement  On the other hand  if there was indeed some kind of accommodation  Thucydides s failure to mention it is odd  In his digression on the pentekontaetia his aim is to explain the growth of Athenian power  and such a treaty  and the fact that the Delian allies were not released from their obligations after it  would have marked a major step in the Athenian ascendancy  Conversely  it has been suggested that certain passages elsewhere in Thucydides s history are best interpreted as referring to a peace agreement  There is thus no clear consensus amongst modern historians as to the treaty s existence,"[1684, 5749, 434, 2636, 15, 30, 1486, 10, 4514, 2933, 4987, 1, 1361, 2, 1, 1289, 2, 0, 1818, 0, 2367, 4985, 20, 3063, 4987, 12, 67, 1185, 2, 7722, 7, 80, 71, 0, 3, 8053, 31, 68, 2828, 1835, 2933, 6247, 12, 0, 8, 7517, 12, 6, 1835, 7, 80, 33, 1, 0, 515, 36, 0, 6, 1289, 94, 80, 16, 186, 356, 273, 17, 2277, 12, 0, 7, 1035, 6307, 5, 6, 1835, 12, 24, 6414, 43, 3590, 13, 8053, 4, 3847, 164, 90, 2219, 32, 2715, 20, 51, 2488, 35, 194, 5623, 5, 1, 6233, 2, 1, 1835, 8, 1626, 6, 273, 0, 10, 1, 1626, 2, 1, 1835, 15, 1, 3392, 2400, 2, 1, 0, 18, 0, 4, 3847, 23, 1156, 58, 2044, 4, 1, 694, 2, 67, 1185, 2, 1289, 1241, 9, 1, 49, 793, 164, 73, 7, 3297, 67, 1185, 2, 7722, 0, 8, 1563, 5, 0, 20, 15, 5652, 4, 19, 0, 9, 1, 0, 19, 5488, 15, 5, 2581, 1, 1286, 2, 0, 254, 3, 81, 6, 1835, 3, 1, 693, 12, 1, 0, 1462, 21, 36, 119, 18, 27, 0, 33, 20, 51, 39, 1667, 6, 194, 1964, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 20, 42, 43, 931, 12, 1136, 3780, 3096, 4, 0, 8, 189, 32, 152, 4256, 11, 6307, 5, 6, 1289, 1241, 73, 15, 602, 68, 1129, 3842, 5749, 434, 2636, 11, 5, 1, 1835, 8, 1626]"

Finally there is often a need to correct for the apparent movement of the stars  On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other  Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth s rotation about its axis  However  the Earth spins rather like a spinning top  Not only does the Earth rotate  it wobbles  The Earth s axis takes around    years to complete one full wobble  The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today  Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris as they do now  In the case of the Egyptian pyramids  it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban  a faint star in the constellation of Draco  The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time  historically speaking  For instance a person born on  December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation Capricorn  In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes,"[741, 73, 15, 347, 6, 1435, 5, 2715, 10, 1, 3669, 640, 2, 1, 906, 9, 1, 0, 2, 512, 0, 1, 906, 39, 1119, 1292, 1, 149, 328, 3208, 5, 125, 49, 125, 421, 37, 1142, 5, 5282, 147, 1, 0, 7570, 225, 5, 1, 867, 8, 6921, 70, 29, 3023, 83, 1, 867, 0, 437, 128, 6, 0, 265, 36, 69, 515, 1, 867, 5282, 20, 0, 1, 867, 8, 3023, 763, 147, 85, 5, 957, 35, 496, 0, 1, 690, 5, 1, 0, 15, 12, 906, 122, 36, 1076, 53, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1003, 4, 1, 149, 2986, 11, 37, 244, 1132, 3760, 122, 1, 906, 5282, 147, 6707, 11, 37, 244, 241, 4, 1, 520, 2, 1, 7648, 0, 20, 42, 43, 1135, 37, 21, 4991, 432, 0, 6, 0, 348, 4, 1, 4494, 2, 0, 1, 690, 106, 25, 3553, 53, 1533, 367, 7423, 2, 48, 4693, 2927, 10, 4514, 6, 888, 582, 9, 196, 4, 945, 237, 51, 39, 43, 582, 13, 1, 1388, 4, 1, 4494, 0, 4, 1, 434, 401, 6, 888, 582, 9, 1, 149, 965, 51, 39, 1, 1388, 4, 0, 225, 5, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0]"

The second attack started just before     In a coordinated strike  dive bombers flew high overhead to begin their runs while torpedo bombers approached from all directions at just above sea level  Overwhelmed by the number of targets  the battleship s anti  aircraft guns were less than effective  and the Japanese tried desperate measures to break up the attack  Yamato s main guns were loaded with Beehive shells fused to explode one second after firing  a mere    m     ft  from the ship  but this had little effect  Three or four torpedoes struck the battleship on the port side  and one to starboard  Three hits  close together on the port side  are confirmed  one struck a fireroom that had been hit earlier  one impacted a different fireroom  and the third hit the hull adjacent to a previously damaged outboard engine room  increasing the water that had already been flowing into that space and possibly causing flooding in nearby locations  The fourth  unconfirmed  hit may have struck aft of the third  Garzke and Dulin believe this would explain the rapid flooding that reportedly occurred in that location  This attack left Yamato in a perilous position  listing     to port  Counterflooding all of the remaining starboard void spaces lessened this to    but further correction would have required either repairs or flooding the starboard engine and fire rooms  Although the battleship was in no danger of sinking at this point  the list meant that the main battery was unable to fire and her maximum speed was limited to  knots   km  h   mph,"[1, 75, 350, 509, 204, 65, 4, 6, 6549, 870, 3981, 1924, 5627, 134, 5489, 5, 1529, 27, 636, 59, 2456, 1924, 2290, 18, 50, 3791, 16, 204, 918, 371, 555, 0, 14, 1, 105, 2, 3027, 1, 2226, 8, 653, 423, 623, 21, 455, 62, 1720, 3, 1, 337, 1712, 3320, 3035, 5, 1082, 63, 1, 350, 3910, 8, 208, 623, 21, 5494, 13, 0, 2894, 0, 5, 0, 35, 75, 33, 2713, 6, 5342, 115, 240, 18, 1, 227, 31, 26, 24, 369, 690, 54, 40, 89, 4773, 1096, 1, 2226, 9, 1, 584, 307, 3, 35, 5, 6555, 54, 1415, 480, 381, 9, 1, 584, 307, 32, 1419, 35, 1096, 6, 0, 12, 24, 43, 546, 655, 35, 0, 6, 286, 0, 3, 1, 220, 546, 1, 4120, 2350, 5, 6, 663, 962, 0, 1530, 937, 1845, 1, 238, 12, 24, 712, 43, 4509, 52, 12, 679, 3, 1432, 1283, 1007, 4, 1029, 4500, 1, 438, 0, 546, 72, 39, 1096, 4498, 2, 1, 220, 0, 3, 0, 2364, 26, 51, 2581, 1, 4689, 1007, 12, 2397, 1182, 4, 12, 1079, 26, 350, 200, 3910, 4, 6, 0, 328, 3730, 5, 584, 0, 50, 2, 1, 616, 6555, 0, 6425, 0, 26, 5, 31, 273, 0, 51, 39, 825, 494, 4663, 40, 1007, 1, 6555, 1530, 3, 269, 1244, 146, 1, 2226, 7, 4, 68, 2600, 2, 7377, 16, 26, 356, 1, 564, 1265, 12, 1, 208, 2473, 7, 638, 5, 269, 3, 34, 1174, 488, 7, 738, 5, 1983, 156, 320, 583]"

The basic technique for GMAW is quite simple  since the electrode is fed automatically through the torch  head of tip   By contrast  in gas tungsten arc welding  the welder must handle a welding torch in one hand and a separate filler wire in the other  and in shielded metal arc welding  the operator must frequently chip off slag and change welding electrodes  GMAW requires only that the operator guide the welding gun with proper position and orientation along the area being welded  Keeping a consistent contact tip  to  work distance  the stick out distance  is important  because a long stickout distance can cause the electrode to overheat and also wastes shielding gas  Stickout distance varies for different GMAW weld processes and applications  The orientation of the gun is also important  it should be held so as to bisect the angle between the workpieces  that is  at  degrees for a fillet weld and  degrees for welding a flat surface  The travel angle  or lead angle  is the angle of the torch with respect to the direction of travel  and it should generally remain approximately vertical  However  the desirable angle changes somewhat depending on the type of shielding gas used  with pure inert gases  the bottom of the torch is often slightly in front of the upper section  while the opposite is true when the welding atmosphere is carbon dioxide,"[1, 2511, 2834, 10, 0, 15, 1273, 1688, 161, 1, 0, 15, 5621, 3575, 110, 1, 3630, 353, 2, 2318, 14, 1407, 4, 1805, 0, 3198, 2771, 1, 0, 929, 0, 6, 2771, 3630, 4, 35, 793, 3, 6, 1692, 0, 3129, 4, 1, 49, 3, 4, 0, 700, 3198, 2771, 1, 8022, 929, 1279, 6409, 168, 0, 3, 709, 2771, 0, 0, 5476, 69, 12, 1, 8022, 4486, 1, 2771, 718, 13, 3220, 328, 3, 0, 150, 1, 135, 94, 0, 3344, 6, 4642, 1608, 2318, 5, 123, 1301, 1, 6697, 61, 1301, 15, 552, 129, 6, 136, 0, 1301, 106, 935, 1, 0, 5, 0, 3, 30, 0, 0, 1805, 0, 1301, 7463, 10, 286, 0, 0, 6141, 3, 3769, 1, 0, 2, 1, 718, 15, 30, 552, 20, 415, 25, 251, 102, 11, 5, 0, 1, 2386, 71, 1, 0, 12, 15, 16, 2435, 10, 6, 0, 0, 3, 2435, 10, 2771, 6, 2742, 1130, 1, 2325, 2386, 40, 301, 2386, 15, 1, 2386, 2, 1, 3630, 13, 3020, 5, 1, 1229, 2, 2325, 3, 20, 415, 541, 1534, 754, 3927, 83, 1, 0, 2386, 762, 5532, 3111, 9, 1, 1333, 2, 0, 1805, 88, 13, 3290, 0, 0, 1, 3046, 2, 1, 3630, 15, 347, 1364, 4, 536, 2, 1, 1181, 600, 59, 1, 3239, 15, 1160, 47, 1, 2771, 2654, 15, 3056, 5437]"
